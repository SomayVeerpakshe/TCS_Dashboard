# TCS Stock Dashboard (Streamlit + Python)

An interactive stock analysis dashboard for TCS built using Python, Streamlit, and financial data from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`).  
This project demonstrates my ability to collect, clean, and visualize financial data for actionable insights.


## 🚀 Features
- Historical TCS stock price visualization (line & candlestick charts)
- Key indicators: Moving Averages, RSI, Volume trends
- Interactive filters (date range, frequency, indicators)
- Built with Streamlit for a simple and clean UI

  ## 📸 Demo
⚠️ Since `yfinance` has request limits, the live app may not always work.  
Instead, here are screenshots of the dashboard:

## 🛠 Tech Stack
